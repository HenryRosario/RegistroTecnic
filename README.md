# Android Room with Jetpack Compose Demo

This Android Studio project demonstrates how to use Room with Jetpack Compose to save data locally to SQLite.

**What you'll learn:**

* Setting up Room with Jetpack Compose
* Creating entities and data access objects (DAOs)
* Performing CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on local data

**Prerequisites:**

* Basic knowledge of Android development
* Familiarity with Jetpack Compose

**Getting started:**

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/enelramon/RoomDemo.git](https://github.com/enelramon/RoomDemo.git)

 * Open the project in Android Studio.
 * Run the app on an Android device or emulator.
Exploring the code:
The project consists of the following key components:
 * Entity classes: These represent the data models that will be stored in the database.
 * DAO interfaces: These define the methods for interacting with the database, such as inserting, updating, and deleting data.
 * Room database class: This class extends RoomDatabase and provides access to the DAOs.
 * Jetpack Compose UI: The app uses Jetpack Compose to create a user interface for adding, viewing, and managing data.
Additional notes:
 * This is a basic example, and you can extend it to include more features, such as searching and filtering data.
 * For more advanced usage of Room, refer to the official documentation: https://medium.com/jetpack-composers/jetpack-compose-room-db-b7b23bd6b189
